Running Editor Script Code on Launch

Sometimes, it is useful to be able to run some editor script code in a project as soon as Unity launches without requiring action from the user.

You can do this by applying the InitializeOnLoad attribute to a class which has a static constructor.

A static constructor is a function with the same name as the class,

declared static and without a return type or parameters

Example Code:

using UnityEngine;
using UnityEditor;
 
[InitializeOnLoad]
public class Startup 
{
	static Startup()
	{
		Debug.Log("Up and running");
	}
}
